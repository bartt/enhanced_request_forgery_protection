= Crumblr

A plugin to protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery. From
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crsf:

<i>Cross-site request forgery, also known as one click attack or session
riding and abbreviated as CSRF (Sea-Surf) or XSRF, is a kind of
malicious exploit of websites. Although this type of attack has
similarities to cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site scripting
requires the attacker to inject unauthorized code into a website,
while cross-site request forgery merely transmits unauthorized
commands from a user the website trusts.</i>

== Prevention

For the web site, switching from a persistent authentication method
(e.g. a cookie or HTTP authentication) to a transient authentication
method (e.g. a hidden field provided on every form) will help prevent
these attacks. Use Crumblr to include a secret, user-specific token in
forms that is verified in addition to the cookie.

== Example usage

  app/controllers/account_controller.rb:

    class AccountController < ApplicationController
      before_filter :verify_crumb
      ...
    end

  app/views/account/login.rhtml:

    <% form_for :form, :url => {:action=> "login"} do |f| -%>
      <%= crumb_tags %>
      ...
    <% end -%>

== Resources compatible

Crumblr works with well with resources. Crumbs are verified for all
HTTP verbs but GET as GET is commonly used w/o form submission.

== Cookie Session Store Incompatible

Crumblr relies on constant session IDs to verify that an issued crumb
is valid. Session cookie change everytime data is added to the
session, which renders this store incompatible with Crumblr.
